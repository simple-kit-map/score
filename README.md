# **s**imple **core**

The core plugin for skm
* duel command (atm there's only requests)
* knockback command
* dash & double jump
* misc listeners

Depends on [Essentials](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html) to query warp list, and [Playerkits2](https://github.com/Ajneb97/PlayerKits2) for kits. It'd be ideal to have make our own warp and kit in the future though.
